This code is a simple PHP web page that displays "Hello, Praneeth!" in a heading. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. The PHP opening tag `<?php` at the top is not needed here and should be removed, as the PHP code is already embedded inside the HTML.
2. The HTML structure defines a basic web page with the title "Praneeth".
3. Inside the `<h1>` tag, PHP code is used:
   - `$name = "Praneeth";` assigns the string "Praneeth" to the variable `$name`.
   - `echo "Hello, " . $name . "!";` outputs the text "Hello, Praneeth!" by concatenating the string with the variable.
4. The result is a web page with a large heading: **Hello, Praneeth!**

**Note:**  
Remove the first `<?php` at the top of the file to avoid a syntax error. The correct code should start with `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
